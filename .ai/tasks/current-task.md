# 🔄 **REMAINING TASKS:**

## Source Tracking Enhancement

**Priority:** High - Important for user experience

- [ ] **Receipt Name Tracking:**
  - [ ] Update `ShoppingListItem` type in `src/types.ts` to include existing `source` field
  - [ ] Update `GenerationReviewItemDto` to include source recipe name
  - [ ] Modify `GenerationService.confirmReviewedItems()` to pass recipe name to existing `source` column
  - [ ] Update shopping list display to show item source (recipe name) from `source` field
  - [ ] Add visual indicator in shopping list UI to distinguish generated vs manual items
  - [ ] Consider adding filter/group by source functionality in shopping lists
  - [ ] Ensure proper handling of `source` field in existing database operations

## UX Enhancement - One-Click Editing

**Priority:** Medium - Improves user experience

- [ ] **Inline Editing Improvements:**
  - [ ] Remove edit button requirement - make all fields directly clickable/editable
  - [ ] Implement click-to-edit for product name, quantity, and unit fields
  - [ ] Add visual hover states to indicate editable fields
  - [ ] Auto-save changes on blur/enter without requiring separate save action
  - [ ] Add subtle visual feedback when field is in edit mode (border highlight, etc.)
  - [ ] Ensure category dropdown opens on single click
  - [ ] Consider keyboard navigation between editable fields (Tab/Enter)
  - [ ] Maintain current validation and error handling with new interaction model

## Generation Tracking & Analytics

**Priority:** Medium - Important for monitoring and debugging

- [ ] **Database Generation Logging:**
  - [ ] Create database table/schema for generation attempts (generations table)
  - [ ] Track successful generations with metadata (user_id, recipe_text, items_count, timestamp)
  - [ ] Log generation errors with error details (error_type, error_message, recipe_text, timestamp)
  - [ ] Store generation performance metrics (processing_time, ai_model_used, token_count)
  - [ ] Update `GenerationService.generateForReview()` to log attempts
  - [ ] Update `GenerationService.confirmReviewedItems()` to mark successful confirmations
  - [ ] Add error logging in catch blocks with proper error categorization
  - [ ] Consider adding user analytics (most common errors, success rates, usage patterns)
  - [ ] Implement data retention policies for generation logs

## Advanced UX Features ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE

**Priority:** Low - Nice to have

- ✅ **Bulk Actions:** ✅ DONE
  - ✅ Exclude all items by category (e.g., "Exclude all spices")
  - ✅ Exclude all items below certain quantity (e.g., "Exclude all < 1g")
  - ✅ Include/exclude all modified items
  - ✅ Per-category bulk exclude/include actions
- ❌ **Search & Filter:** (Excluded per user request)
  - ❌ Search products by name
  - ❌ Filter by category
  - ❌ Filter by inclusion status
- ✅ **Grouping & Sorting:** ✅ DONE
  - ✅ Group items by category with expansion panels
  - ✅ Sort by product name, quantity, or category
  - ✅ Collapsible category groups with statistics
  - ✅ Toggle between table and grouped view

## Testing Strategy

**Priority:** Medium - Should be implemented

- [ ] **Unit Tests:**
  - `GenerationService.generateForReview()` and `confirmReviewedItems()`
  - `GenerationReviewPageComponent` form validation and state management
  - `ReviewTableComponent` editing logic and validation
  - `ReviewSummaryComponent` calculations
- [ ] **Integration Tests:**
  - Full review flow navigation
  - Form validation scenarios
  - Error handling paths
- [ ] **E2E Tests:**
  - Complete user journey: Generate → Review → Edit → Confirm
  - Error scenarios: invalid data, network failures
  - Navigation: back/forward, browser refresh

## Performance Optimizations ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Priority:** Low - Current performance is acceptable

- ❌ **Large Dataset Handling:** (Not needed for typical use cases)
  - ❌ Virtual scrolling for 100+ ingredients
  - ❌ Pagination for review table
  - ❌ Lazy loading of category data
- ❌ **Form Performance:** (Current performance is acceptable)
  - ❌ Debounce form input changes (currently immediate)
  - ❌ Optimize change detection for large forms
- ✅ **Memory Management:** ✅ DONE
  - ✅ Implement OnPush change detection strategy
  - ✅ Optimize category dropdown rendering with computed values
  - ✅ Efficient sorting and grouping with computed signals

## Code Cleanup

**Priority:** Low - Code is production ready

- [ ] Remove any unused imports or methods
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to constants
- [ ] Consider extracting complex validation logic to separate services
