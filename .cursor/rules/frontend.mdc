## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Angular 19 exclusively for building the entire application, including both static content and interactive components.
- Leverage Angular Material as the sole UI framework to provide accessible, pre-designed components.
- Follow Angular best practices, including modular architecture, dependency injection, and reactive programming with RxJS to build scalable applications.
- Utilize TypeScript 5 for robust type safety and enhanced IDE support.

### Guidelines for Styling

- Rely exclusively on Angular Material’s styling system for consistency and accessibility.
- For custom styles and overrides, use SCSS with modular files and Angular's built-in style encapsulation.
- Employ Angular Material theming to define consistent color palettes and design language across the application.

### Guidelines for Accessibility

- Leverage Angular Material’s built-in accessibility features.
- Ensure all interactive elements and custom components adhere to ARIA best practices by using appropriate roles, states, and properties.
