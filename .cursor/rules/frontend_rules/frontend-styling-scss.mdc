### Guidelines for STYLING

#### SCSS

- Use the ThemeProvider for consistent theming across components
- Implement the css helper for sharing styles between components
- Use props for conditional styling within template literals
- Leverage the createGlobalStyle for global styling
- Implement attrs method to pass HTML attributes to the underlying DOM elements
- Use the as prop for dynamic component rendering
- Leverage styled(Component) syntax for extending existing components
- Implement the css prop for one-off styling needs
- Use the & character for nesting selectors
- Leverage the keyframes helper for animations
- for responsivness use _mixins.scss file instead of @media query
