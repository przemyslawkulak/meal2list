### Guidelines for ANGULAR

#### ANGULAR_MATERIAL

- Create a dedicated module for Angular Material imports to keep the app module clean
- Use theme mixins to customize component styles instead of overriding CSS
- Implement OnPush change detection for performance critical components
- Leverage the CDK (Component Development Kit) for custom component behaviors
- Use Material's form field components with reactive forms for consistent validation UX
- Implement accessibility attributes and ARIA labels for interactive components
- Use the new Material 3 design system updates where available
- Leverage the Angular Material theming system for consistent branding
- Implement proper typography hierarchy using the Material typography system
- Use Angular Material's built-in a11y features like focus indicators and keyboard navigation
